# GENEVOLite-GENetic-EVolutionary-Organoid
The lite version of GENetic EVolutionary Organoid: The Self-Evolving Neural Architecture. Inspiration: Biological genes — evolution, adaptation, and infinite creative potential. Goal: Surpass every major AGI benchmark (ARC, HLE, AGI v1/v2, and beyond) through a truly self-evolving architecture that learns, adapts, and rewrites itself.
